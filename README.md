# RJDev
This is a personal blog regarding my reflections on my experience of phase-0 with EDA, Nikau-2016.

It is a WIP (pre-pre-alpha) and will change, **A LOT**.
Please bear with me as I hone my skills through this, and other projects. :)

I removed one 'pre'! I'm making some progress. But there's not much to see yet, besides the About page and a couple of early projects. XD
I also need to do a lot of styling work on the welcome message on the home page.


#Back-End
I've just got a free heroku account at the moment, so until I have a place to deploy my back end, it only runs locally. :/
You can set it up for yourself, though! :D

Just do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/rene-justin-dado/rj-dev-back-end.git
npm i
npm start
```

# For the Future
The projects definitely need a 'credits' section. It's very important to give credit where credit's due!

I need to set up my API for my blogs as well. I've hard-coded one entry to a route. Not ideal. >.<

It is not yet optimised for mobile, so that's something to think about. XD
