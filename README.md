# personal-blog
This is a personal blog regarding my reflections on my experience of phase-0 with EDA, Nikau-2016.

It is a WIP (pre-pre-alpha) and will change, **A LOT**.
Please bear with me as I hone my skills through this, and other projects. :)

I removed one 'pre'! I'm making some progress. But there's not much to see yet, besides the About page. XD
I also need to do a lot of styling work on the welcome message on the home page.
